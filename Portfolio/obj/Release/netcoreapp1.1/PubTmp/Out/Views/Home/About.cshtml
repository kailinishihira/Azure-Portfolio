            I am a junior web developer with over 10 years of experience in the customer service and hospitality industry.
            I recently completed a web development course with a focus on C#/.NET at Epicodus in Seattle.
            I enjoy spending most of my time with my dog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/momokokissu/" target="_blank"><strong>Momo</strong></a>, and partner, Scott.
            My other interests include astrology, the NBA, traveling, writing poetry, and sewing.
